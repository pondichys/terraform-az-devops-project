# Azure Devops Processes

Processes define how Azure Devops Boards and the work tracking system will function.

There are 4 system default process types.

- Basic
- Agile
- SCRUM
- CMMI

Those 4 processes cannot be customized. You can create your own customized processes called Inherited processes.
