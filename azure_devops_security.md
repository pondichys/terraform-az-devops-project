# Azure Devops Security Concepts

There are some fundamental concepts to take into account when designing the security of an Azure Devops Organization, especially if it is linked to an Azure AD directory.

## Permissions, access and security groups

Azure Devops users are assigned to one or more security groups. These groups are assigned permissions that allow or deny usage of a feature.

Each users are also assigned an access level which grants or restricts access to select web portal features.

## Access levels

Access levels control what features are visible to users in the web portal and are dependent on user licenses.

## Permissions

Permissions control a user's hability to connect to Azure Devops and use features (like Boards, Repos, etc ...)

Default permissions and access are documented here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/permissions-access?view=azure-devops
